                Despite having played in a mid-major conference, Butler rose to national prominence in the late 1990s. They ranked
                in most media polls for all but a few weeks from the 2006 to 2007 season to the 2011 to 2012 season, and competed in the
                postseason every year since 1997, except for 2004, 2005, and 2014. In the 2010 NCAA tournament, Butler was the
                National runner-up to Duke, advancing to the National Championship Game after defeating Michigan State in the
                    Final Four. With a total enrollment of only 4,500 students, Butler is the smallest school to play for a
                    national championship since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985. The Bulldogs also went to the
                    championship game in the following NCAA tournament, falling to UConn after defeating VCU in the Final Four.
                    With the victory over VCU, Butler became the first mid-major program to reach the championship game in 
                    successive seasons since 1979, when seeding of the tournament began, and the only team from the state of
                        Indiana to reach back-to-back championship games. The Bulldogs also won the National Championship in 1927,
                        though it was before March Madness so it does not count for NCAA records.

                Because of the school's history of basketball success, location in the heart of the land of "Hoosier Hysteria", and
                lack of a scholarship football program, the Butler University fan base is primarily basketball-oriented. Other
                athletics enjoy substantial followings of current students and alumni, but only basketball has garnered interest
                from a national audience. Two studies estimated that television, print, and online news coverage of Butler's 2010
                    and 2011 appearances in the NCAA tournament championship game resulted in additional publicity for the university
                    worth about $1.2 billion. In an example of the "Flutie effect", applications rose by 41% after the 2010
                    appearance.[4] In June 2011, USA Today ranked Butler as one of the top five colleges making use of social media.
